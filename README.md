Hello there! I'm Tyler (but most people call me Ty). I work as a web-developer and lab technician (separate jobs) at the Centre For Digital Humanities. 
At Hum-IT PortalDev we create web-portals that support both research and education at the UU Faculty of Humanities. I mostly focus on maintaining my teams libraries, creating re-usable components and other supporting roles.

At the ILS Labs researchers conduct (pyscho)linguistic experiments, using various methods like eye-tracking, EEG and (speech) production. I focus on keeping the labs and surrounding infrastructure running and help researchers getting familiar with the setups. In addition, I perform most of the Linux desktop management, using Puppet.  

### Used technologies

**Web development**
Django (REST), SCSS, Vue (TypeScript), (sadly) jQuery, CodeIgniter

**Other**
Puppet, Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora/RHEL), ZEP, Java
